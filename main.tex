% In the file EDITABLE-setup/setup.tex
% you can change all sorts of stuff like 
% your name, distances between different elements,
% colors of things, sizes, etc.

% Then the folder EDITABLE-sections contains files,
% and each file corresponds to a section.
% You can add/remove/edit the files.
% When a section has been either added or removed,
% the corresponding change needs to be included in 
% the file EDITABLE-sections/0-all.tex.
% This file includes the structure of the whole CV.
% Finally, the file EDITABLE-sections/bibliography.bib
% contain bibtex references.

% can be included in the CV sections:
